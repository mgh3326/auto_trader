"""Deterministic per-symbol stage (ROB-369 E12).

Per-symbol ``symbol`` snapshots are captured by ``SymbolSnapshotCollector`` but
no stage consumed them, so the captured per-symbol context never reached Hermes
(orphaned in *every* market — crypto observed it, but kr/us were affected too).

This stage surfaces the captured snapshots into ``stage_inputs``: one
``key_point`` per resolved symbol (held marker + name/sector/market_cap, plus
quote liquidity when the collector enriched it), and requested-but-unresolved
symbols under ``missing_data``. It is descriptive context, not a directional
call, so the verdict is always ``NEUTRAL`` — no bull/bear is invented from
symbol metadata. Read-only over persisted snapshots; no LLM, no broker calls.

Known limitation (ROB-369): ``SymbolSnapshotCollector`` resolves per-symbol
metadata from ``stock_info`` and only enriches quotes for KR + ``kis_live``.
``stock_info`` has no crypto rows and there is no Upbit quote adapter yet, so
crypto symbols resolve thin today — this stage then reports them honestly under
``missing_data`` (``unresolved_symbols``) rather than fabricating metadata.
Enriching crypto symbol snapshots (an Upbit ``upbit_symbol_universe`` collector
path + orderbook adapter) is a separate follow-up slice; the capture→synthesis
disconnect this stage fixes is market-agnostic and benefits KR/US immediately.
